## Thoughts 

 - Going to re-watch the classwork which emulates the page setup
 - Firstly going to setup pages as the plan states, once base functionality is present I may change some of the pages to different input types. 
 - I think the hardest part from opening the project up will be the final button to reset the submission. I have a hard time checking if the submission is actually being sent correctly and being reset.
